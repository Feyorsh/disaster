Disaster lets you press `C-c d` to see the compiled assembly code for the
C/C++ file you're currently editing. It even jumps to and highlights the
line of assembly corresponding to the line beneath your cursor.

It works by creating a `.o` file using make (if you have a Makefile) or the
default system compiler. It then runs that file through objdump to generate
the human-readable assembly.

### Installation


Make sure to place `disaster.el` somewhere in the load-path and add the
following lines to your `.emacs` file to enable the `C-c d` shortcut to
invoke `disaster`:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/PATH/TO/DISASTER")
    (require 'disaster)
    (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "C-c d") 'disaster)


### Function Documentation


#### `(disaster-create-compile-command-make MAKE-ROOT CWD REL-OBJ OBJ-FILEPROJ-ROOT REL-FILE FILE)`

Create compile command for a Make-based project.



#### `(disaster-create-compile-command-cmake MAKE-ROOT CWD REL-OBJ OBJ-FILEPROJ-ROOT REL-FILE)`

Create compile command for a CMake-based project.



#### `(disaster-get-object-file-path-cmake COMPILE-COMMAND)`

Get the .o object file name from a full COMPILE-COMMAND.



#### `(disaster &optional FILE LINE)`

Show assembly code for current line of C/C++ file.

Here's the logic path it follows:

- Is there a Makefile in this directory? Run `make bufname.o`.
- Or is there a Makefile in a parent directory? Run `make -C .. bufname.o`.
- Or is this a C file? Run `cc -g -c -o bufname.o bufname.c`
- Or is this a C++ file? Run `c++ -g -c -o bufname.o bufname.c`
- If build failed, display errors in compile-mode.
- Run objdump inside a new window while maintaining focus.
- Jump to line matching current line.

If FILE and LINE are not specified, the current editing location
is used.



#### `(disaster-find-project-root &optional LOOKS FILE)`

General-purpose Heuristic to detect bottom directory of project.

This works by scanning parent directories of FILE (using
`disaster--find-parent-dirs`) for certain types of files like a
`.git/` directory or a `Makefile` (which is less preferred).

The canonical structure of LOOKS is a list of lists of files
to look for in each parent directory where sublists are ordered
from highest precedence to lowest.  However you may specify
LOOKS as a single string or a list of strings for your
convenience. If LOOKS is not specified, it'll default to
`disaster-project-root-files`.
